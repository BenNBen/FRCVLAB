# FRCVLAB
Fordham University Robotics and Computer Vision Laboratory.

A great deal of this code was developed with Luca del Signore, my coworker in the lab, under the supervision of Dr. Damian Lyons. Code mentioning only my name represents work that I had programmed for the lab, myself.

The code within this repository is representative of work developed for the use of the HSVD, Homing with Stereo Vision of Databases, project. These source files range from code used directly within the HSVD program to scripts which are used to improve performance or generate valuable information on test results.
